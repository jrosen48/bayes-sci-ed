Insbesondere das bekannte Preprint der Arbeitsgruppe um Christian Drosten und die öffentlichen Gutachten dazu haben viel Aufmerksamkeit erhalten. Dieses spezielle Open Peer-Review-Verfahren wird analysiert, um in der Diskussion um die Zukunft interner Wissenschaftskommunikation als praktisches Fallbeispiel zu dienen. Es zeigt sich, dass ein solches Verfahren auch völlig frei von einer sammelnden oder koordinierenden Stelle erfolgreich und bereichernd ablaufen kann. Nichtsdestotrotz müssen solche Prozesse künftig zumindest infrastrukturell besser organisiert sein.},
